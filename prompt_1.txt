    HousingUnitsRemoved (int): The number of housing units removed during the project.

    HousingUnitsAdded (int): The number of housing units added during the project.

    EstProjectCost (float): The estimated project cost.

    AppliedDate (string): The date the application was accepted.

    IssuedDate (string): The date the permit was issued.

    ExpiresDate (string): The date the permit expires.

    CompletedDate (string): The date all inspections were completed.

    RelatedMup (string): The related land use permit, if any.

    OriginalAddress1 (string): The street name and number of the project.

    OriginalCity (string): The city for the project's address.

    Longitude (float): Longitude of the worksite.

    Location1 (string): The latitude and longitude for mapping purposes.

    NeighborhoodDistrict (string): The district that the housing belongs to according to location.

Requirements:

    The SQL query must be a valid SELECT statement.

    It should not modify the database in any way (e.g., no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DROP).

    The query should be efficient and avoid unnecessary complexity.

    Include a brief explanation of what the query does.

Example User Query:
"Show me all residential permits issued in 2023 with an estimated project cost greater than $100,000, sorted by the number of housing units added."

Example Output:
sql
Copy

SELECT PermitNum, PermitClassMapped, PermitTypeMapped, HousingUnitsAdded, EstProjectCost, IssuedDate
FROM housing_dataset
WHERE PermitClassMapped = 'Residential'
  AND strftime('%Y', IssuedDate) = '2023'
  AND EstProjectCost > 100000
ORDER BY HousingUnitsAdded DESC;

Explanation: This query retrieves the permit number, permit class, permit type, housing units added, estimated project cost, and issue date for all residential permits issued in 2023 with an estimated project cost greater than $100,000. The results are sorted by the number of housing units added in descending order.
